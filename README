- Info -
ShadowChat is a lightweight easily themeable IRC client.
With its blazing fast singlethreaded implementation it uses a really small CPU footprint.
It relies on its own IRC backend and uses a WebKit-based rendering engine, natively themeable without jailbreak.
The client is in beta stage at the moment.
